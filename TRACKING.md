# Usage Tracking

_Pinterest for WooCommerce_ implements usage tracking, based on the native [WooCommerce Usage Tracking](https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/), and is only enabled when WooCommerce Tracking is enabled.

When a store opts in to WooCommerce usage tracking and uses _Pinterest for WooCommerce_, they will also be opted in to the tracking added by _Pinterest for WooCommerce_.

## What is tracked

As in WooCommerce core, only non-sensitive data about how a store is set up and managed is tracked. We **do not track or store personal data** from your clients.
